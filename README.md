# Got-Your-Card
A web browser, text-based game to see how well you know your family and friends.

# Running
I originally planned to cloud host this game, but I lack the funds to do so.
To run the backend on a local network:
1. Make sure you have NodeJS installed
2. Clone this repository
3. Navigate to the repo directory in a command line
4. Enter "npm install" 
5. Enter "npm run start"
6. Other players can access it via "<your ip address>:3000"
