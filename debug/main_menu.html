    <h2>How To Play</h2>
    <p>
        Each round, everyone writes down a question. Afterwards, each
        player must answer the question every other player submitted. Then,
        the original writer of each question will see all the answers they 
        got. The goal is to match each answer to the player you think
        wrote it. Whoever gets the most right wins!
